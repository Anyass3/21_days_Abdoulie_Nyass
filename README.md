# 21_days_Abdoulie_Nyass
21 days of data science
roadmap freestyle: ML

### Day 1
Model Classification

### Day 2
- Build a Logistic Regression Model with Sklearn
- made predictions with the model
### Day 3
model evaluation
  - confusion  matrix

### Day 4
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - Precision & Recall Trade-off

### Day 5
  - f1 score
 - now using sklearn metrics to calculate:
  - precision
  - recall
  - f1 score
  - confusion  matrix
### day 6
  - Training and Testing in Sklearn
  
      > using the **train_test_split** function will randomly put each datapoint in either the training set or the test set. 
      
      > By default the training set is 75% of the data and the test set is the remaining 25% of the data.

   - Building a Scikit-learn Model Using a Training Set
   - Using a Random State 

          > To get the same split every time, we can use the random_state attribute. We choose an arbitrary number to give it, and then every time we run the code, we will get the same split

### Day 7
  - An ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) Curve
  - An ROC Curve is a graph of the **sensitivity** vs. the **specificity**
  - Sensitivity & Specificity in Scikit-learn
  - Adjusting the Logistic Regression Threshold in Sklearn
### Day 8
  - How to Build an ROC Curve
  - ROC Curve Interpretation
### Day 9
  - Picking a Model from the ROC Curve
  - comparing two ROC curves
  - started k-fold Cross Validation
### Day 10
  - data preprossing normalization
### Day 11
  - preprocessing text data
### Day 12
  - using naive_bayes and vectorizers
### Day 13
  - TfidfVectorizers
  - hash vectorizers
  - bag of words
  - n_gram vectorizers
